# Trajectory-shooting-assistance

‘Parabolic shooting gun’ is a setup which works based on the principle of trajectory motion. The
gun is developed in a way such that, it can shoot a ball to the target in a parabolic way with
automatic distance calculation assistance. The angle of projection is calculated by using a tilt
sensor. In this gun, the velocity of the ball will be constant.The integral part of the gun is the
microcontroller which automatically determines the horizontal distance the ball can cover, when
it is shot in a specific angle, by using the data from accelerometer. There will be a display module
attached to the gun to display the angle of projection and distance. So the player can change the
angle of projection to meet the distance to the target.
